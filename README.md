# Kaggle Projects Repository

Welcome to my Kaggle Projects repository! Here, I showcase my personal solutions developed throughout my data science and machine learning learning journey.

## Repository Purpose

This repository documents my personal challenges on Kaggle, where I engage with various datasets and problems to sharpen my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and other facets of data science.

## Current Projects

Here's a list of projects I have tackled to date (the projects contains EDA, Statistical Analysis, Feature Engineering and Modeling):

1. üìä[Sentiment Analysis Mental Health BERT XGBOOST](Sentiment%20Analysis%20Mental%20Health%20BERT%20XGBOOST) : Developed a sentiment analysis model on a curated mental health dataset, leveraging BERT for feature extraction and XG Boost for classification, achieving 91% accuracy.

2. üìä[Advanced Sales Forecasting Integrating ANOVA and Multiple Linear Regression](Advanced%20Sales%20Forecasting%20Integrating%20ANOVA%20and%20Multiple%20Linear%20Regression) : Developed an advanced sales forecasting model by integrating ANOVA and multiple linear regression. Explored data patterns to enhance prediction accuracy, providing valuable insights for strategic advertising and optimizing sales performance.

3. ü§ñ[Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling](Binary%20Classification%20of%20Insurance%20Cross%20Selling) : Developed a binary classification model using XGBoost classifier to predict bank customer churn rate through insurance cross-selling by exploring customer demographics, policy details, and purchase behaviors.

4. üìä[Flood Hazard Prediction Using Regression Techniques](Flood%20Hazard%20Prediction%20Using%20Regression%20Techniques) : Developed a flood hazard prediction model using regression techniques, explored various data sources to enhance accuracy and reliability of predictions.

5. üõ≥Ô∏è[Taxi Fare Estimator](Taxi%20Fare%20Estimator) : Developed a regression model to estimate fare rates of a trip after extensive data cleaning and feature engineering.
